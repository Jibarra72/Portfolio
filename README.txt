In the inital design document, I intended to have my contact
infromation right below my name at the home page of the profile,
but I opted to have it in the about me page along with the
information on my interests. I also intented to have my tabs be all
grouped up together in a single drop down menu, but, I instead
made them into a navigation bar at the top of the page. 
As for what I implemented in each week:
1st Week: I created the webpages that would be used
2nd Week: I added a navigation bar that included all the tabs that would be in my website as clickable links. 
3rd Week: I added some placeholder text in some places of the website that would later be changed to relevant information.
4th Week: I started to create style for things such as paragrahs, headers, and even the navigation bar. I also inserted a table into my 
          expericence tab that contains the education that I have.
5th Week: I added a background and images to my webpage to make it look less empty and cut some unncessary webpages from the website.
6th Week: I added frames to my "About Me" webpage along with some relevant information about myself.
7th Week: I polished up the website a bit by deleting some unncessary stuff such as sections and articles to make the website more clean.
          I also changed the main color scheme of the website from a bright orange and aquamarine to a bit of a darker blue and black to 
          make it more relaxing on the eyes in addition to adding some images and buttons.
